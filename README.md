## Description

The Kanban Board Web Application is an agile project management tool that helps visualize work being done by teams. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks within different columns, providing an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for easy task management.

## Features

- Create and manage columns in card design format.
- Rename and delete columns as needed.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks within each column.
- Drag and drop tasks from one column to another for easy task movement.
- Maximum limit of 5 columns to keep the board organized.
- Mobile and desktop-friendly, thanks to the use of a Service Worker for offline use.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
